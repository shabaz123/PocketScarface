# PocketScarface

PocketScarface is an open source implementation of the popular children's 'sound box' type of toy that has a load of buttons and a speaker, for playing amusing sound effects.

The code here executes on Pi Pico boards loaded with the CircuitPython system.

See video here: https://youtu.be/lFec_H5jbUc 

To use, place the code along with up to ten short MP3 files (I used 64 kbps mono file format) into the CircuitPython USB memory location that appears when you plug the Pi Pico into the PC.

The Pi Pico board needs connecting to buttons and to an off-the-shelf "MAX98357 I2S DAC/Amplifier" board (available from Adafruit, AliExpress, etc).
